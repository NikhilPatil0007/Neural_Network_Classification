# Linear Neural Network Classification

## Overview
This project implements a simple linear neural network to classify data points into binary classes. The dataset used is generated using the `make_circles` function from `sklearn`. The model is built using PyTorch and demonstrates basic neural network concepts like forward propagation, loss computation, and backpropagation.

## Features
- Linear neural network with two fully connected layers.
- Binary classification using the Sigmoid activation function.
- Visualizes decision boundaries and model performance.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Synthetic dataset generated with `make_circles`.
- **Description**: Two features (`X1` and `X2`) with binary labels.

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer: 2 neurons.
- Hidden Layer: 5 neurons with linear activation.
- Output Layer: 1 neuron with sigmoid activation.

## Dependencies
- Python
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
